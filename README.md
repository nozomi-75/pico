# Pico
A dead-simple, responsive site layout — written purely in HTML and CSS. A work in progress, view sample PageSpeed Insights data [here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-nozomi-75-github-io/jjraadbzbr?hl=en&form_factor=mobile).
> Webdev is also a form of art in itself. Art is a form of expression. I wanted to express my feelings through Pico — how I want things to be simple and neat, how I want the elements to be consistent, how I want the site to behave similarly regardless of the browser — amidst all my discontentment in current practices. Not that my practices are any better, but I hope that it will grow up to be as I take up more projects.
